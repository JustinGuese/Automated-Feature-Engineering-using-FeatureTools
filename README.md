Automated Feature Engineering using FeatureTools 

In this Kaggle Notebook I am exploring the usage of FeatureTools (https://www.featuretools.com/) to automatically generate features using their package.

Feature Engineering usually takes a lot of time, and oftentimes a computer might see relations and correlations that might be otherwise missed. 

TODO: The ipynb currently fails for loading data, because the data is Kaggle exclusive. You will need to import the Jupyter Notebook to Kaggle in the matching challenge for it to work. See my Kaggle notebook for further details: https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/scriptcontent/25011555
